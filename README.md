> *"The best way to learn architecture is to take it apart and build it back up, one concept at a time."*

## 👋 About Me
Hello! I am **Prasanna Lakshmi Motati**, a final-year B.Tech student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**. 

While my academic background is in AI, my true passion lies in **Backend Engineering**. I am fascinated by the logic, scalability, and architecture that powers the web. Over the last few months, I have transitioned from solving DSA problems (GFG160 & LeetCode) to building robust systems using **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

I am currently seeking opportunities to launch my career as a **Software Engineer**, with a focus on backend development.

## 💡 The Philosophy Behind This Repository

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Concept Labs**. 

When learning a framework as vast as Spring Boot, it is easy to get lost in "tutorial hell"—building generic To-Do apps without understanding the internal magic. I decided to take a different approach.

**This repository is not just a collection of apps; it is a documentation of my experiments.** Instead of building one massive, messy application, I am building **concept-wise mini-projects**. Each project in this folder focuses on isolating and mastering a **single specific Spring Boot concept** (such as a specific annotation, a configuration pattern, or an architectural style).

My goal is to move beyond *"It works"* to *"I know exactly **why** it works."*

## 📂 Project Index & Concept Map

Here is the archive of concepts I have explored so far.

| # | Project Name | 🧠 Core Concept Explored | 📝 Technical Takeaway |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **01** | [**Notification Engine**](./Notification-Engine) | **`@ConditionalOnProperty`** | Explored how to create flexible beans. This project dynamically switches between an **Email Service** and an **SMS Service** based on a simple flag in `application.properties`, without changing a single line of Java code. |
| **02** | *Work in Progress* | *Dependency Injection* | *Deep dive into Constructor vs Field Injection...* |
| **03** | *Upcoming...* | *Spring Profiles* | *Managing Dev/Prod environments...* |
